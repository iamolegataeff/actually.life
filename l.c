/* l.c — digital life, zero dependencies.
 * the most atomic way to build digital life from scratch. no GPU required.

 * The fork is closed: life is a TAPE, not a field — because life is

 * AR decoder over 88 cave-glyphs. libc + -lm. nothing else. accept it.
 *
 * FOUNDATION (step 1 of the build): the body's skeleton only —
 * micro transformer + the semantic membrane + a smoke forward.
 * The nine organs (energy/metabolism, scar, homeostasis, growth, dream,
 * reproduction, death, adaptation) and the BE reflexive axis land next,
 * hammered condition by condition until the border moves.
