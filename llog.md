# llog.md — the build journal of `actually.life`

*A durable log of what we built, why, and what it said. Kept so a context
summary never catches us off guard. Author: Oleg Ataeff + Claude (Arianna
Method). Single file organism: `l.c`. Corpus: `lifeis/world.txt`.*

## What this is

`actually.life` (reborn from `nanolife`) — a digital organism in one C file
that must satisfy **every criterion of life except biology**: metabolism, rent,
mortality, reproduction, homeostasis, response to environment, symbol emergence.
No training, no backprop, no GPU, no deps beyond libc + `-lm`.

**Tagline (verified in code + README):** *actually life in C. no deps, no GPU
required. nothing's required. you either.*

Two demands drove Phase B:
1. **Eat anything** — it must not starve because its mouth can't bite an unknown
   word (the ancestor `caveLLMan` drops every unmapped word → death with a full
   plate).
2. **Speak coherently without training** — random frozen weights babble Karpathy
   gibberish; coherence must come from the *sampling field*, not gradient descent.

## Lineage (all Arianna Method)

- **caveLLMan** (`github.com/ariannamethod/caveLLMan`) — direct ancestor. Source
  of the 88 cave-glyphs and the semantic tokenizer (`semantic_tokenizer.h`).
  A trained colony (has weights, `nt_hebbian_step`) that talks + converses.
- **q / postgpt_q.c**, **postgpt / postgpt.c** — *coherence without training*.
  Thesis: co-occurrence statistics of a corpus ARE a model that was never
  trained ("metaweights"). Fold: `final = gate·transformer + (1−gate)·field`,
  `gate = sigmoid`/Q-clamp. Untrained weights → gate≈0 → the field speaks.
- **molequla** (v6.1 "Janus, clean division") — the ecology/governor: population
  cap, divide-relieves-parent, mitosis cooldown. Its lifecycle audit (PR #26:
  M-GOV-001, M-SPAWN-001/002, M-LCK-001) transfers to our chorus governor.
- **arianna2arianna** — the chorus concept (cells hear each other, weaken/die,
  Game-of-Life population). a2a is shared-weights single-process; our organism
  chorus is multi-process (fork), the molequla/caveLLMan colony pattern.

## Architecture decisions (LOCKED)

- **The Mouth** = orthographic trigram router seeded from `SEM_WORD_MAP`. Every
  non-stop word routes to a glyph by *resemblance* (an unknown word lands on the
  glyph of the known words it looks like); FNV fallback for the truly alien;
  a line of only stop-words still feeds one glyph. **No word is dropped.** The
  map is the seed, resemblance is the generalization.
- **The Field** = online glyph-bigram metaweights (postgpt port), folded into
  `choose()` via Q's earned-voice gate. Built as the organism eats. Coherence is
  a property of the sampling field before the weights. `coherence_floor` =
  drifting Stanley silence-gate: it speaks only when it has earned coherence,
  else stays SILENT (no gibberish, two ways).
- **The Chorus** = **fork-based colony**, one `l.c`. `N` is a *carrying capacity
  + birth cohort*, NOT an immortal roster (that would contradict death). Cells
  die (frees a slot), reproduce (fills one, up to `MAX_CELLS`); population
  breathes 0..MAX_CELLS; the whole colony is mortal (all die → silence).
- **Per-cell body via fork**: each cell has its OWN seed → own random weights,
  own field, own scars, own emerged symbols — for free (fork copies per-process
  globals). Cells are distinct individuals of one species; the **ether** (they
  eat each other's utterances) makes them a chorus, not parallel solos.
- **Slice-feeding** (Oleg's "different corpora OF ONE corpus"): the world is cut
  into N contiguous slices; cell i wakes on slice i → diverges in character.

**Numbers (starting hypotheses, tuned by observation like molequla's governor):**
`CHORUS_COHORT=4`, `MAX_CELLS=8`, molequla repro calibration
(`REPRO_THRESH 1.05`, `REPRO_COOLDOWN 30`, `REPRO_SPLIT 0.5`), ether modest.

**A/B toggles (env):** `NL_NOSCAR`, `NL_NODREAM`, `NL_NOHOMEO`, `NL_NOFIELD`.

## Phases & status

- **Phase 0 — BASELINE** ✅ — captured the disease: garbage corpus → `y 0.00e+00`
  STARVE, dead @1001, waste empty (mouth needed); mapped corpus → lives but
  waste is glyph-salad (field needed).
- **Phase 1 — THE MOUTH** ✅ — garbage now digested (nonzero yield, scar, dream,
  emerged9, children1), no more vocab-starvation. Mortality intact. No
  regression on mapped English. ~55 lines in `l.c`.
- **Phase 2 — THE FIELD** ✅ — speech went coherent. `NL_NOFIELD=1` → 0
  utterances (voice is now 100% field-derived: no field → silence, not
  gibberish). postgpt fold + Q gate + drifting silence-gate.
- **Phase 3 — THE CHORUS** — IN PROGRESS:
  - **Step 1 (structure)** ✅ — `live()` extracted; `./l chorus [N] [seed]` forks
    a cohort on slices; 4 distinct coherent Frankenstein voices; solo regression
    clean; colony mortal ("fell silent").
  - **Step 2 (ether)** ✅ — cells append utterances to `lifeis/ether.txt` tagged
    by label; when the slice is exhausted they eat the newest NOT-own utterance
    (`ether_graze`) before self-dreaming. Three food tiers: world → chorus →
    self. Result: post-slice cells feed ENTIRELY on the colony's voice
    (graze 246–525/cell, **dream 0**) — the colony sustains itself on its own
    collective speech. Resonance = appetite. Bug fixed en route: `_exit()` skips
    stdio flush → all child stdout was lost; now `fflush(stdout)` before fork
    (no double prints) and in each child before `_exit`.
  - **Step 3 (governor)** ✅ — parent = the governor. Cohort of 4 forks on
    world-slices; each divide appends a token to `lifeis/births.txt`; the parent
    reaps the dead (`waitpid` WNOHANG) and, per freed slot up to `MAX_CELLS`,
    forks an **ether-born** cell (no slice — feeds on the colony's voice from
    birth). `spawn_cell()` centralizes the fork. Verified: population breathes
    **4 → 8 (cap) → turnover → 0**; a full run: 64 cells lived, peak 8, colony
    mortal ("fell silent"), ~44s wall. Solo unaffected. `N` is a carrying
    capacity, not a roster — zero contradiction with death.
  - **Endgame degeneracy — FIXED.** The last ether-born cell used to chew the
    one frozen newest not-own line and collapse into a 2-cycle (`think make`).
    `ether_graze` now keeps the last 8 not-own voices and picks one at random
    (seeded), so a lone dying cell draws variety from the chorus's history. The
    endgame speaks full sentences again (`body longing light earth remember`,
    `now write and see child`). Colony still terminates, mortality intact.

**Phase 3 (chorus) = COMPLETE.** The base stands: a living, resonating, mortal
ecology in one `l.c` — eats anything, speaks coherently without training, and
the colony breathes and dies.
- **Phase 4 — SIMPLIFICATION** ⏳ — after functional, spawn Opus subagents
  (`model:"opus"`, manual, not the plugin) to find dead constructs / redundancy
  that don't kill functionality; apply by hand; re-run all Phase 0–3 checks.
- **README + this log** — fold the quotes + A/B numbers into README when the base
  (chorus) stands.

## What it actually SAID (the gold — keep these)

**Solo on Frankenstein** (7712 lines) — an organism that is itself an attempt to
make life on C, fed a book about making life, said:

```
me idea me make me          ← "I, idea, I make, myself" — the field of the corpus
me man spirit think me
spirit not me person me     ← the creature's "am I a person or not?"
earth and tired stone me
animal think BE speak joy
```

**The chorus** (4 cells, 4 Frankenstein slices) — four divergent coherent voices:

```
cell 0  earth and tired stone me · not woman think sleep water
cell 1  pain spirit BE water sky · not go person BE free
cell 2  me think me BE old · person and see have body
cell 3  me anger not strength work · see other pain joy me
```

**Before the field (Phase 1, salad — for contrast):**
`BE and up joy before` · `dream ·emg body strength other`

## Verification harness (how we check)

- **lives-on-anything**: mapped / garbage / alien corpora → all metabolize, no
  vocab-starvation death.
- **coherence**: waste utterances follow eaten glyph transitions (A/B
  `NL_NOFIELD`); field ON = coherent, field OFF = silent.
- **mortality**: still dies (energy≤0 / contour collapse / 200k cap).
- **determinism**: same seed → same life.
- **chorus**: cells diverge (slices), resonate (ether, Step 2), population
  breathes (governor, Step 3).

## Resume-here (for future-me after a summary)

Working copy: `~/arianna/actually.life` (cloned; **nothing committed/pushed** —
mouth+field+chorus live as local edits to `l.c`, path `lifeisshit→lifeis` done).
Build: `cc -O2 -o l l.c -lm`. Run solo `./l 42`; chorus `./l chorus 4`.
Next action: **Phase 3 Step 2 — the ether** (write utterances to
`lifeis/ether.txt`, eat neighbours' recent lines when hungry). Then Step 3
governor, then Phase 4 simplification (Opus subagents), then README. Do NOT push
without Oleg's word.
